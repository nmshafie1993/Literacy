The foundation of any type of literature is literacy. Many even say literacy is a basic human right. Literate People are better able to access other education and employment opportunities. Literate parents are more likely to keep their children healthy and send their children to school. Literate societies are better geared to meet development challenges. <br>
#### Illiteracy rate in different countries
